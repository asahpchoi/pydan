---

#### **Patient Information**
*   **Name:** [REDACTED]
*   **HN:** [REDACTED]

*   **Gender:** Female

- **Request By:** DR. DECHA WIMOL Chaidith
- **Report Type:** U/S UPPER ABDOMEN (ULTRASSÐž grabETRY OF Upper ABDOMEN)
- **History:** Follow up

---

#### **Findings**
*   **Liver:**
  - Normal size and smooth surface.
  - No space-taking lesion.
  - Multiple cysts scattering in the liver (0.4-4.3 cm).

Note: No evidence of portal hypertension or other complications (e.g., hemangion).

*   **Bile duct:**
  - No dilatation of IHD and CBD.

---

#### **Gallbladder**
*   **Gallbladder:**
  - Normal distension.
  - No gallstone.

Note: Two medium echogenicity nodules in the gallbladder wall (about 0.3 cm and 0.4 cm). These are suggestive of *gallbladder polyp*.     

*   **Pancreas:**
  - No visible pancreas.

---

#### **Spleen**
- Spleen is normal, parenchymal echogenicity present. No hydronephrosis or calcified cyst wall changes.

---

#### **Kidneys**
- Aorta: Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity, no hydronephrosis.
- Decreased size of a 0.6-cm hyperechoic lesion at lower pole left kidney (now about 0.9 cm).
- A bright lesion at lower pole left kidney (0.3 cm). This suggests possible renal stone or calcified cyst wall.

*   **Changes since last reported:**
  - No change due to hemangiomyolipoma of the lower pole left kidney.

---

#### **Aorta**
- Normal findings, no dilatation.

### **Conclusion**

1. Multiple cysts scattered in the liver (now about 0.4-4.3 cm).
2. Two medium echogenicity nodules in the gallbladder wall (about 0.3 cm and 0.4 cm), suggestive of *gallbladder polyp*.
3. Decreased size of a cyst at lower pole left kidney (now about 0.9 cm).
4. A bright lesion at lower pole left kidney (0.3 cm), possibly renal stone or calcified cyst wall.

### **Footnotes**

1. No hyperechoic lesion on the same findin.
2. Possibly hemangiomyolipoma.
